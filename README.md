REST API CLIENT DETAILED DESCRIPTION:-

As part of my internship, I developed a REST API Client in Java. The objective of this project was to create a Java application capable of consuming a public REST API, sending HTTP requests, receiving JSON responses, and displaying the data in a structured format. For my implementation, I chose a weather API that provides real-time data such as temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions. The project not only strengthened my understanding of file handling and HTTP communication but also gave me valuable exposure to working with APIs and JSON parsing in Java.

Tools I Used

To successfully complete this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

Java Development Kit (JDK)

I used the Java Development Kit (JDK) to compile and run my program. Java provided the foundation for writing the client application, handling HTTP connections, and parsing JSON responses. The standard Java libraries such as HttpURLConnection were used to establish the connection with the API server.

org.json Library (JSON Parser)

Since REST APIs typically return data in JSON format, I needed a JSON parsing library to extract useful fields like temperature and wind speed. I used the org.json library (json-20230227.jar) to parse the JSON response. This library allowed me to easily convert the raw JSON string into a structured object and access values using keys.

Command Prompt (Execution Environment)

For compiling and running the program, I used the Windows Command Prompt. This provided me with a direct way to navigate to the project folder, compile Java files with the required classpath (to include the JSON library), and execute the application. Using the terminal gave me a hands-on understanding of how Java projects are executed in real-world environments without relying on graphical IDEs.

Notepad (Code Editor)

I chose Notepad as my editor for writing the code. While it is a very basic editor, it allowed me to type and save the .java file quickly. This reinforced the idea that even without advanced IDEs, Java development is entirely possible with simple tools, provided I understand the workflow of compiling and running programs through the command line.

Platform I Used

I worked on the Windows operating system and ran my Java application directly through the Command Prompt. This approach ensured that I could fully control each step of the process—writing the code, saving it, compiling it with the necessary JAR library, and executing it to see the output. By not using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, I gained more insight into the internal compilation and runtime processes of Java programs, which is extremely beneficial for building strong fundamentals.

Future Uses and Applications

The REST API Client I built has several practical applications and opens the door to numerous future possibilities:

Weather Applications

The current project can be extended into a full-fledged weather application with a graphical interface. By consuming APIs from providers like OpenWeatherMap, I can create a tool that displays hourly forecasts, humidity, and weather alerts.

Integration in Mobile Apps

REST API Clients are the backbone of mobile and web applications. The knowledge I gained here can help me in the future when working with Android apps, where fetching data from APIs is a common requirement.

Data Analysis Projects

By consuming APIs that provide financial data, stock market prices, or sports updates, I could build analytical tools. The JSON parsing skills I developed will be equally useful when dealing with datasets from such APIs.

IoT and Smart Systems

REST APIs are widely used in IoT devices for communication. For example, weather APIs can be integrated into a smart home system to adjust room temperature or control fans based on outside conditions.

Career and Industry Relevance

In today’s software industry, REST API integration is a critical skill. Almost every application, whether enterprise software or consumer apps, requires interaction with APIs. Understanding how to consume APIs in Java provides me with a strong foundation for backend development, cloud computing, and microservices.

Conclusion

Completing this REST API Client project was a significant learning experience. By using tools such as Java JDK, org.json library, Notepad, and Command Prompt, I successfully created a working client that fetches real-time weather data and displays it in a structured format. Working in the command-line environment allowed me to deeply understand the step-by-step process of writing, compiling, and executing Java programs.

The project also highlighted the real-world importance of REST APIs and JSON parsing, both of which are essential in modern application development. I believe the knowledge I gained through this task will be valuable in future academic projects as well as in my professional career, where REST APIs play a central role in enabling software systems to communicate effectively.
